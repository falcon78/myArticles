# Fighting Procrastination

- If there is a task you can do within 2 minutes, just do it!
- Always you plan your day in advance. Don't let your mind decide what to do next.
- Break the task into small part and do the easiest stuff first.
- The hardest part is starting, once you build up a momentum it trivial to keep going.
