# Rule of product. (Fundamental principle of counting)

- The rule of product states that if there are n ways of doing something, and m ways of doing another thing after that, then there are n×m ways to perform both of these actions. In other words, when choosing an option for n and an option for m, there are n×m different ways to do both actions.

# Permutation

- In combinatorics, a permutation is an ordering of a list of objects. For example, arranging four people in a line is equivalent to finding permutations of four objects. More abstractly, each of the following is a permutation of the letters a,b,c, a, b, c,a,b,c, and d: (4! possibilities)

  - ​a,b,c,d
  - a,c,d,b
  - b,d,a,c
  - d,c,b,a
  - c,a,d,b.​

> The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n!, the factorial of n.
