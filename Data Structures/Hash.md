# Hashmap

Hashing is an improvement over **Direct Access Table**.

- Using the key directly as index to array without hashing is known as **Direct Access Table**

- We use hash function that converts a given key to a smaller number and uses the small number as index in a table called hash table.

## Terminology

### Hash Function

- A function that converts a given key to a small practical integer value (ex. index to hash table).

### Associative array

- An abstract data structure which implements the API described above. Also called a map, symbol table or dictionary.

### Hash table

- A fast implementation of the associative array API which makes use of a hash function. Also called a hash map, map, hash or dictionary.

### Associative array

An abstract data structure. Also called a map, symbol table or dictionary.
