# Procrastination
[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/Dci3o/a-procrastination-preview)

When you encounter something you would rather not do, you seem to activate areas of the brain associated with pain. When this happens your brain looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by focusing on something else. But it turns out that when you actually start doing things you didn't want to do, the discomfort disappears. So, start doing the things that you have to! The hardest part is starting.

##### Steps of procrastination

1. You have a task you would rather not do.
2. You turn into something that is more pleasant to you.
3. This, in turn, makes you happy but only temporarily.

##### Methods to help with procrastination

* Pomodoro Technique ( Do something for 25min and give yourself a break for 5min )

It is possible to change and become accomplished in fields you didn't think you could do very well.

When learning something, you have to understand the concepts not remember them. When you learn something you create neural links that help you remember or understand the material. And as you practice more these neural links start to make strong connections and you retain that knowledge for a long time. Also using a metaphor to understand certain new concepts can also be really helpful.

##### Long term memory

It's like a warehouse of memories distributed throughout your brain. Different memories are stored in different parts of your brain. Use techniques like spaced repetition to retain whatever you're trying to learn for a long period of time. Cramming is not efficient and you won't retain that knowledge.

##### Working memory

When you are trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together to solve a problem, you use your working memory. You don't retain this memory for a long period of time.

# The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Sleeping help washes out metabolic toxins your brain produces during you are awake. If you don't sleep the toxins accumulate and you end up in a state where you cant think clearly. Too little sleep can also be associated with headaches, depression, heart disease and dying early.

During sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're learning. The prefrontal cortex at the forefront of your brain (the conscious you) is deactivated, which helps your brain focus on things that you are learning. Sleep allows your brain to rehearse difficult material; going over and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn. Sleep also erases a less important part of your memories.
