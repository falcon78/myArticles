## What is a Chunk.

- Chunks are pieces of information bound together through meaning or use.

- A chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.

- Chunking is a metal leap that helps you unite bits of information (chunk!) together through meaning.

- When you are angry, stressed or afraid your pre-fontal cortex cant make connections to other parts of brain, decreasing your ability to think or understand a material.

## How to form a chunk

- Try to learn the material step by step. Focus on a small chunk and build upon those slowly.

- Focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk. Keep all the distractions like cell phones away. When you are learning a new material your brain is making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through out your brain. But your brain can't do this effectively if you are distracted.

- Understanding the material you are learning is very crucial. Understanding is like a super glue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together. It creates board encompassing traces that can link to other memory traces. But just understanding is not enough. You have to be able to solve the problem yourself. No matter how long you stare at a painting, you wont be able to draw it unless you actually try to do it yourself.

- A important step to chunking is to gain context, so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk. Context means going beyond he initial problem and seeing more broadly. There is a bottom-up chunking where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can access it whenever you need to. There's also top down big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in. Context is where where bottom-up and top-down learning meet. For example glancing through chapter titles before reading the book can help you see what you are going to lean (big picture). It helps you know where to put the chunks that you are constructing.

## Illusions of Competence and Learning Efficiently

- Try to recall the materials that you have just learned. This help you remember the concept better.

- Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning.

- Highlighting and underlying must be done very carefully. Otherwise it can not only be ineffective, but also misleading. It's as if, making lots of motion with you hand can fool you into thinking you've placed the concept in your brain. Try to keep underlining to minimum and only highlight main ideas.

- When you have the book or Google open right in front of you, it provides the illusion that the material is also in your brain. But it's not ! Because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn't effective.

- A helpful way to make sure you're learning and not fooling yourself with illusion of competence, is to test yourself on whatever you're learning.

- Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material.


## What motivates you

- **Acetylcholine** - Neurons that form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when you are paying close attention. Acetylcholine also helps form long term memory. 

- **Dopamine** - Dopamine neurons in brain controls reward learning. Dopamine is released from these neurons when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning and decision making. Dopamines also predict future  rewards, which can motivate  you to do something that may not be rewarding now, but will lead to a  much better reward in the future. Loss of dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation and something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure.

- **Serotonin** - Serotonin is a third diffuse  neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life. In  monkey troops, Alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity. Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of serotonin activity. Serotonin is also closely lined to risk-taking behavior, with higher risk in lower serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.

## The value of a Library of Chunks

- Chunking is essential to learning. Multiples chunks that you have formed can interlink to provide you with more border knowledge. 

- There are two ways to solve a problem.
    - Reasoning about each step and solving the problem step by step. (Focused thinking mode)
    - Using intuition to solve a problem intuitively. (Diffused thinking mode)
    **You should be careful because intuition is not always right.**

- When encountered with a lot of new materials to learn, try not to get overwhelmed and try learn to learn each chapter or a thing step by step. You will find that some of those problem share similarities and things you have learned help you understand new concepts later on.

## Over-learning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

- Do not try to overstudy the topics that you have already mastered. It might to easy to solve trivial problems but they don't teach you a lot. Deliberately focus on problems you find difficult.

- **Einstellung** - When your initial thought or an idea you have in mind or neural pattern you've already developed may prevent a better idea or solution from  being found.

- **Interleaving** - Try to mix up the problems. If you are already aware how to approach a problem then solving that problem won't teach you much. Revisit problems about topics you have previously learned.
