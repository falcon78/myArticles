# Focus vs Diffuse Thinking

### Brains have different modes of thinking

##### Focused Thinking

Problem solving (when you concentrate intently on something), focusing on one problem very hard. Uses the front right side of the brain.

##### Diffuse Thinking

(Relaxed thinking) Learning new things, understanding new concepts. Uses the left back side of the brain. Think broadly. You cant think in both focused and diffuse mode at once.
