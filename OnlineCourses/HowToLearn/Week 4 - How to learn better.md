# How to become a better learner.

- The best gift you can give your brain is physical exercise.
- When ever you  hit  a wall while learning and can't seem to understand new material
or even forget what you knew, this happens when your mind is reconstructing it's understanding.
When you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, you gain a deeper understanding
of the material you are trying to learn.
- Metaphors helps you learn new concept efficiently.
