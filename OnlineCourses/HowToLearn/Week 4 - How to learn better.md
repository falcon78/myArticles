# How to become a better learner.

- The best gift you can give your brain is physical exercise.
- When ever you  hit  a wall while learning and can't seem to understand new material
or even forget what you knew, this happens when your mind is reconstructing it's understanding.
When you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, you gain a deeper understanding
of the material you are trying to learn.
- Metaphors helps you learn new concept efficiently.

# Hard Start - Jump to east

- Start with the hard questions, then move on to easy questions. Starting hard, loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away to it.

# Being stressed

- When you are being stressed by something (exams), try to interpret that deeling think positively. Think not 'this test has me stressed' but 'this test has me do my best!' and be excited.
- Try to focus on your breathing and relax.
