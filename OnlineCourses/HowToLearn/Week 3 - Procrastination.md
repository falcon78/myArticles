## Habits

- The cue

  - Habits are triggered by certain cue (Doing something after looking at a todo list)
  - The cue themselves are harmful, its what we do when we receive the que thats harmful.

- The routine

  - When a habit is triggered you fall into the habitual routine you are used to following. (Procrastinating when faced with a difficult task.)

- The reward

  - Every habit develop and continue because it rewards us.
  - Procrastination is easy to build habit because the reward (focusing on things that are more pleasant) is so easy and quick.
  - Rewarding good study is important for escaping procrastination.

- The belief

  - Habits have a power of your belief in them. (ex. Believing that you cant study right now, and putting it off until late in the day or day before the deadline.)

## Process not Product!

- Don't focus on the goal. Focus on how you will get there or focus on the process of getting there. (Ex. Don't focus on completing a certain task, focus on doing it.)

  - Example: Well its just only five question, i will finish it later. <- Focusing on the goal. (But what if the questions are long and hard? You done goofed up!)

## Planning

- Write a task list!!!! Preferably during the previous day. When your mind has something to follow it will get easier to do that.

- Also write a weekly task list if you can.

- Do not study everything at one go! Take breaks or do something else (Go shopping or for a walk! Physical activity is good for you!)

- Plan your quitting time!!! This helps you to have something to look forward to! And reward yourself after a long study session.

- At the end of the day wrote a journal, reflecting on your studies or what you did throughout the day.
