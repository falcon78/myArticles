# Linear Equation

- $3x + y = 2$ ( $x$ and $y$ are **variables**, 2 is a **constant** term and 3 is the **coefficient** of x.)

- The  degree of a term is the sum of the powers of the variables in that term.
  - Eg. degree of x is 1, degree of $xy^2$ is three.

- Linear equation
  - An equation whose degree is 1.
  - There are also no variables raised to fractional powers.
  - $x+\sqrt{x} = 3$ is not a linear equation.

## Two Equations, Two Variable

- Eg. Solving $x+y = 3$ for $x$ and $y$
  - We write a solution to this equation as an **ordered pair** $(x,y)$
  
- Systems of equations
  - eg. $\begin{pmatrix} x+y = 3 \\ x-y = 1 \end{pmatrix}$
