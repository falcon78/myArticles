# The square root of -1

- $i$ multiplied by itself is $\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1} = -1$

  - But if we try to combine radicals, $\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{(-1)^2} = 1$. We will get the wrong answer!!!!

- Power of i go in cycles.
  - i, -1, -i , 1, i , -1 ... (ex. $i^5 = i$, can also be solved as $i^{x mod 4}$)

# Complex number operations.

## Vocabulary

- $3$ is real and complex but not imaginary.
- $3i$ is not real, but is complex, imaginary and pure imaginary.
- $3 + 3i$ is neither real nor pure imaginary.

## Calculations

- Additions

```math {cmd}
	(z_1 + z_2i) + (w_1 + w_2i) = (z_1 + w_1) + (z_2 + w _2)i
```

- Subtraction

```math {cmd}
	(z_1 + z_2i) - (w_1 + w_2i) = (z_1 - w_1) + (z_2 - w _2)i
```

- Multiplication

```math
	(z_1 + z_2i) * (w_1 + w_2i) = z_1 * (w_1 + w_2i) + z_2i * (w_1 + w_2i)
```

- Division (Rationalize)

```math
	\frac{(z_1 + z_2i)}{(w_1 + w_2i)} = \frac{(z_1 + z_2i)}{(w_1 + w_2i)} * \frac{w_1 - w_2i}{w_1 - w_2i}
```

- $Re(a+bi) = a$
- $Im(a+bi) = b$

- Conjugate $\overline{z}$

```math
	z = a+bi
```

```math
	\overline{z} = a-bi
```
