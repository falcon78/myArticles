## Counting
- Number of integer between 0 and n exclusive is $n-1$.
	- Number of integer between a and b exclusive is: $(b-a)-1$
	- Number of integer between a and b inclusive is: $(b-a)+1$

## Multiplication

- Number of ways six coins come up when flipped. (**Independent**)
	- Possibility: 2 #(Heads or tails)
	- Number of coins 6
	- $2^6 = 64$ ways. 
	- ($a^b$ where a #a is number of possibilities and #b is trial count.)
	* > Each **independent** contributor adds a factor of its number of possibilities to the overall product.

- How many four letter 'words' are there with vowels in the middle two places and a consonant at the end? 
	- $(26 choices) * (5 choices) * (5 choices) * (21 choices) = 13650$ ways.
